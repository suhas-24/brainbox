## The Code Explained

# This is literally all you need for a basic AI chatbot:

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="your-key")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

That's it! BrainBox just makes this pattern reusable and production-ready.
